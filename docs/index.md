# Cheat Sheets for Data Science Learning

This repository serves as a hub for various Cheat Sheets related to 
the field of Data Science (with Python). What sets these Cheat Sheets apart is their 
multidimensional approach to enhancing the learning experience. 
Each Cheat Sheet is made available in three distinct formats: 

* **PDF**: <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open in PDF-%23FF0000.svg?style=flat-square&logo=adobe&logoColor=white"/> 
* **Streamlit**: <img src="https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg"/>
* **Google Colab**: <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
